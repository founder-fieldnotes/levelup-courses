title: RAG & Knowledge-Driven NLP
questions:
  - type: mc
    stem: Which retrieval approach uses inverted indexes and term frequencies?
    options: [Dense retrieval, TF-IDF/BM25, Encoder-decoder, Re-ranking only]
    answer: TF-IDF/BM25
  - type: tf
    stem: In top-k retrieval evaluation, higher recall@k generally indicates better coverage.
    answer: true
  - type: mc
    stem: A core benefit of RAG compared to pure generation is:
    options:
      - Lower latency in all cases
      - Access to up-to-date or domain-specific knowledge at query time
      - No need for any retriever component
      - It replaces evaluation entirely
    answer: Access to up-to-date or domain-specific knowledge at query time
  - type: tf
    stem: Hybrid retrieval combines sparse (e.g., BM25) and dense vectors.
    answer: true
