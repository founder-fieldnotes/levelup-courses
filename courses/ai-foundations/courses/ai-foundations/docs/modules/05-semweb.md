# 05 · Semantic Web in Practice

**Objectives**
- Represent knowledge as triples (subject–predicate–object).
- Apply simple rules to infer new relations.
- Understand how KGs can augment NLP outputs.

**Lab (Autograded)**
- **Assignment:** “05-semweb” on GitHub Classroom  
- **Tasks:**
  1. Implement `make_triples(data)` in `src/kg.py` to convert text into triples.
  2. Implement `infer_grandparent(triples)` to add inferred relations.
  3. Write tests verifying the new triples are added correctly.

**Quiz**
- 10 items on triples, predicates, rule‑based reasoning, and KG integration with NLP.

**Rubric**
- All tests pass (70%)  
- Correct inference logic and no duplicates (20%)  
- README diagram showing the KG (10%)
